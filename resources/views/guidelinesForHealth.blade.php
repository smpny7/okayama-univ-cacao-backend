            <strong>Health Screening Guideline in the App</strong>
            <p>
                This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
                policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
                Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to
                the collection and use of information in relation to this
                policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
                used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with
                anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
            <p>
                For a better experience, while using our Service, I
                may require you to provide us with certain personally
                identifiable information, including but not limited to Okayama University Student ID, Health Screening.
                This data is used to deny entry to people who are clearly above normal or unwell.
                The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.
                This app does not make medical decisions and does not provide medical information.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
            <p>
                I may employ third-party companies and
                individuals due to the following reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
                <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
                <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
                <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I want to inform users of this Service
                that these third parties have access to your Personal
                Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
                them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
                disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
            <p>
                I value your trust in providing us your
                Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
                of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
                storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                guarantee its absolute security.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</strong></p>
            <p>
                These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
                I do not knowingly collect personally
                identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case
                I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                me with personal information, I immediately
                delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
                and you are aware that your child has provided us with
                personal information, please contact me so that
                I will be able to do necessary actions.
            </p>
